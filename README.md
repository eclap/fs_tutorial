This is a tutorial for my experimentation in using ExpressJS, DynamoDB and React.

Note that the steps are tested in a Linux Ubuntu based OS.

If you are using a different OS, please use the counterpart commands in your OS.

Feel free to update this documentation based on your setup. This helps as a reference to others that might have similar setup.

If you require assistance, please don't hesitate to ask.

## Local Setup

### Requirements:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)

### Steps:

Specific setups are located on each folders. 

Check the respective README files of "front-end" and "back-end" folders.

Note that it is ideal to setup the "back-end" first as "front-end" requires it to be fully functional.
